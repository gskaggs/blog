**Notes:** 

Gaiman didn't go to University. He felt the need to write and put himself out into the world.

He didn't have a career plan. Just a list of things he wanted to do: "to write an adult novel, a children's book, a comic, a movie, record an audiobook, write an episode of Doctor Whoâ€¦"

Gaiman gives the graduating class several pieces of advice:

1. Being young and knowing what is possible or impossible makes doing the impossible that much easier.
1. If you have an idea of what you were meant to do, then just do it. Gaiman conceptualizes his dream of being a great author as a distant mountain. At a crossroads, he'd ask himself which path would take him toward and which would take him away from that mountain.
1. You will have to deal with the painful problems of failure. To Gaiman, the life of a freelance artist "is sometimes like putting messages in bottles, on a desert island, and hoping that someone will find one of your bottles and open it and read it, and put something in a bottle that will wash its way back to you: appreciation, or a commission, or money, or love."
1. Make mistakes. They indicate that you're doing something worth doing. And whatever misfortune presents itself in your life, just remember to make good art.
1. Furthermore, make *your* art. Make the art only you can make. If you start feeling like you're walking naked down the street, then you're on the right track.
1. As a freelancer you get hired however you can. You keep you job by a) doing good work, b) being easy to get along with, and c) getting your work in on time. According to Gaiman, if you think about it, you really only need to achieve any two of these three.
1. Enjoy the ride. Don't worry too much.

Finally, Gaiman concludes that if you don't know what you're doing, then pretend you are someone who is wise or competenet. Then just behave how that person would.

> I learned to write by writing. I tended to do anything as long as it felt like an adventure, and to stop when it felt like work, which meant that life did not feel like work.
