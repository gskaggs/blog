<p><em>Delivered to the 2012 graduating class of the University of the Arts</em></p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>Gaiman didn't go to University. He felt the need to write and put himself out into the world to do that.</p>
<p>He didn't have a career plan. Just a list of things he wanted to do: &quot;to write an adult novel, a children's book, a comic, a movie, record an audiobook, write an episode of Doctor Whoâ€¦&quot;</p>
<p>Gaiman gives the graduating class several pieces of advice:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Being you and knowing what is possible or impossible makes doing the impossible that much easier.</li>
<li>If you have an idea of what you were meant to do, then just do it. Gaiman conceptualized his dream of being a great author as a mountain he was to climb. At a crossroads, he'd ask himself which path took him toward and which took him away from that mountain.</li>
<li>You will have to deal with the painful problems of failure. To Gaiman, the life of a freelance artist &quot;is sometimes like putting messages in bottles, on a desert island, and hoping that someone will find one of your bottles and open it and read it, and put something in a bottle that will wash its way back to you: appreciation, or a commission, or money, or love.&quot;</li>
<li>Make mistakes. They indicate that you're doing something worth doing. And whatever misfortune presents itself in your life, just remember to make good art.</li>
<li>Furthermore, make <em>your</em> art. Make the art only you can make. If you start feeling like you're walking naked down the street, then you're on the right track.</li>
<li>As a freelancer you get your job however you can. You keep you job by a) doinig good work, b) being easy to get along with, and c) getting you work in on time. According to Gaiman, if you think about it, you really only need any two of these three.</li>
<li>Enjoy the ride. Don't worry too much.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, Gaiman concludes that if you don't know what you're doing, then pretend you are someone is wise or competenet, and then just behave how that person would.</p>
