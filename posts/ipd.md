# Genetic Algorithms for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

Before this summer, I had reasonable familiarity with that classic of game theory—[the prisoner’s dilemma](). However, not until I read Richard Dawkins’ [The Selfish Gene]() did I begin to appreciate the incredibly far-reach of this little thought experiment. 

In the book’s twelfth chapter, playfully entitled “Nice Guys Finish First,” Dawkins explains several natural phenomena as examples of prisoner’s dilemma in disguise. Many commonplace interactions—the grooming habits of birds, how wasps pollinate fig trees, the symbiotic bacteria in our guts—turn out to be games where cooperation and defection can mean life or death for evolutionary players, and the individuals which do best are often those best evolved to navigate the paradoxical paradigm.

The natural world often differs from the dilemma’s usual penal context in an important fundamental way. Unlike prisoners at risk of long jail sentences, the two members of a bird population may interact with each other many times. At each meeting they may identify their neighbor and remember his past tendencies to cooperate or defect. Here, the birds’ strategies may depend heavily on the past behavior of their community members.

We call this variation the classic game the iterated prisoner’s dilemma. Strategies do well if they avoid being betrayed and either cooperate with or take advantage of cooperative agents. Unlike the original prisoner’s dilemma, an optimal strategy is by no means obvious and success depends on the strategies which compose an individual’s population. 

Beginning famously with [the work of Axelrod in …](), researchers gone to great lengths exploring [the various possible strategies for the iterated prisoner’s dilemma.]() Stanford’s encyclopedia of philosophy summarizes the literature on this and other variations of the prisoner’s dilemma in [its entry on the topic.]()
