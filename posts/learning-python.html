<h3 id="let-the-googling-begin">1. Let the Googling begin</h3>
<p>Unlike the rest of the items in this list, this is not an action item. Rather it’s a mindset and a warning: Be prepared to Google. A lot. Everything.</p>
<p>If you’re truly starting from scratch with a new language, then you have everything to learn. Accept and embrace that fact.</p>
<p>Not sure how to reverse the characters of string in Python? Google it. Not sure what’s a string in Python? Google it. Not sure what’s a Python in Python? Google it.</p>
<p>Stack overflow will become your friend, as will the online documentation for Python.</p>
<h3 id="use-coding-bat">2. Use Coding Bat</h3>
<p>This website provides an invaluable source of simple programming puzzles. Users can create their own account and watch their progress as they submit correct solution to problems. When I taught Python programming last summer I had students do several problems from each section as homework and left the rest to be done as extra practice at the student’s discretion.</p>
<p>As you do these, I’d urge you to not stop when you see the satisfying green UI element indicating a correct solution. Programming is a craft. Constantly ask yourself: how could I have written this in a more concise way? How could this have been simpler? How could I have gotten to the solution faster?</p>
<h3 id="practice-with-competition-problems-optional">3. Practice with Competition Problems (Optional)</h3>
<p>Note that for the casual learner of Python, this step might be wholly unnecessary, as the fundamentals are sufficient for your purposes.</p>
<p>Soon Coding Bat problems will become too easy. At this point I’d recommend checking out USACO.org and CodeForces to find a large swath of competitive programming problems to challenge you. Here you’ll learn more advanced data structures (This process involves a lot of the Googling from step 1) and gain valuable exposure to the types of questions a Software Engineer might ask you in an interview. In fact, if you’re particularly interested in preparing for such interviews, I’d recommend the classic texts: EPI and CTCI</p>
<h3 id="make-projects">4. Make Projects</h3>
<p>If there’s some project which pulled you to learning Python in the first place. Now’s the time to jump right in. If you know how functions, strings, arrays, arithmetic, and classes work in Python, you probably know enough to start working on whatever project you find exciting. Maybe you’re interested in neural networks. Or video games. Or statistics for biomedical research. In any case, you should know enough to find tutorials and figure things out as you go along. I strongly believe this is the most effective way to learn any language.</p>
<p>For inspiration check out Pyxeled, a project I worked on Python to convert real images into pixel art.</p>
<h3 id="teach">5. Teach</h3>
<p>Remember the munchkins from earlier in the post. What they (and their parents) didn’t realize is that I had no prior education or work experience with Python. I just taught myself through projects and online tutorials. Ultimately, that summer, lecturing about the language and mentoring younger students helped burn the fundamental syntax and more esoteric idiosyncrasies of the language into my head. When you’ve reached a high enough proficiency with Python, I highly recommend tutoring other students or helping any friends who may also be learning the language.</p></div>
