# Developer Tools—Pareto Style

Just like musical compositions, professional tennis players, and styles of font, the attention I give my developer tools falls in a steep Pareto distribution. Here’s my list of essential commands and utilities I use in almost any programming project.

### Git

An immensely popular version control tool.

* `git add .`
* `git commit -m “commit message here”`
* `git pull`
* `git push`
* `git checkout branch-name`
* `git checkout -b new-branch-name`
* `git stash`
* `git merge`
* `git clone`

### Linux

Commands you can use on Unix-based terminals. These work on the CS lab machines as well as your personal computer if you have a mac.

* `cd`
* `ls`
* `mkdir`
* `mv`
* `cp`
* `scp`
* `rm`
* `ssh cs-username@carmen.cs.utexas.edu`

### Vim

I have a love hate relationship with vim. Very useful but pretty ugly. Checkout the tutorial: 

### Oh My Zsh

IMO no terminal is complete until tricked out with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
