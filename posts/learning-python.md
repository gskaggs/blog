# How to Learn Python 

### 1. Start with Coding Bat

[Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/python) provides an invaluable source of simple programming puzzles. Users can create their own account and visualize their progress as they submit correct solutions to problems. When I taught Python programming last summer I had students do several problems from each section as homework and left the rest to be done as extra practice at the students’ discretions.

As you do these, I urge you to pause after you achieve each correct solution. Programming is a craft, and you should constantly ask yourself: how could I have written this code more concisely? How could I make this solution simpler? How could I have solved the problem faster? 

### 2. Practice with Competition and Interview Problems

*Note that for the casual learner of Python, this step might be unnecessary, as the fundamentals acquired in step 2 may be sufficient for your purposes.*

Soon Coding Bat problems will become too easy. At this point I’d recommend checking out [USACO](https://train.usaco.org/), [Hacker Rank](https://hackerrank.com), and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for challenging competitive programming and interview problems. Here you’ll learn more advanced data structures and gain valuable exposure to the algorithmic demands central to software engineering and computer science. 

If you’re particularly interested in preparing for technical interviews, I’d recommend the classic texts: [Elements of Programming Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949/ref=pd_bxgy_img_3/143-1627086-5954734?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1537713949&pd_rd_r=49b81357-cfa3-4495-8346-388615d44715&pd_rd_w=9f7JR&pd_rd_wg=X0yqd&pf_rd_p=ce6c479b-ef53-49a6-845b-bbbf35c28dd3&pf_rd_r=MBNTYJBBJ6T0T7FB1YE8&psc=1&refRID=MBNTYJBBJ6T0T7FB1YE8) and [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850).

### 3. Run with It

Now’s the time to jump right in. You know functions, datatypes, if statements, for loops, classes, and objects? Then you probably know enough to start working on whatever projects you find exciting. Maybe you’re interested in neural networks. Or video games. Or statistics for biomedical research. Find some tutorials and get after it!

For inspiration check out [Pyxeled](https://www.grantskaggs.com/pyxeled), a project I programmed in Python to convert real images into pixel art.

### 4. Teach

Remember the munchkins from earlier in the post. Until then I had no prior formal education or work experience with Python. However, that summer, lecturing and mentoring these younger students burned into me both the fundamentals and elusive idiosyncrasies of the language. When you’ve reached an appropriate proficiency with Python, I highly recommend tutoring other students or helping any friends who may also be learning the language.

### 5. Let the Googling begin

This last one’s a warning and a mindset: Be prepared to Google. 

A lot. 

Everything. 

How do I reverse an array in Python? Beats me, Google it.<br>
What’s the difference between Python versions 2 and 3? Literally everything. Just kidding, Google it. <br>
Not sure what are these classes and objects things in Python? Google it. Your mind will be blown.<br>
Why am I getting an error message? Idk Google it.<br>
Why am I *still* getting the error? Do I look like Google?<br>

You get the picture. 

This process can be annoying, frustrating, and time-consuming. But recognize that not only are you learning how to program, you’re also learning how to find answers to tricky problems and teach yourself difficult concepts—skills far more valuable than knowledge of any individual coding language.

After many, many searches Stack Overflow becomes your best friend, as does the online documentation for Python. You’ll find tutorials, textbooks, and YouTube videos on everything from installing Python to building scalable web servers, from the basics of Python syntax to the magic of object oriented programming. Good luck!
