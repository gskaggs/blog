# Introducing Pyxeled

Transforming normal photographs into aesthetic pixel art. That's Pyxeled.

Inspired by the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2330147.2330154">Pixelated Image Abstraction</a> by Gerstner et al., this application leverages intelligent clustering algorithms to optimally render images at lower resolutions and limited color palettes. 

Check out an image gallary created using Pyxeled as well as an explanation of the algorithms used [here!](https://grantskaggs.com/pyxeled) Feel free also to browse the code for Pyxeled on [its public GitHub repository.](https://github.com/gskaggs/Pyxeled)

I loved the retro low-dimensional feel of this project which garnered no small amount of nastalgia for high school days spent programming video games. The style also served as a welcome relief to the more intense [physical simulation of desert sand dunes](https://github.com/gskaggs/The-Great-Sand-Dunes) I worked on previously.

If you think Pyxeled is cool, you might also enjoy [this fun blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/10/supercharging-style-transfer.html) from Google AI on applying deep learning to transfer style between images.
